# My Emacs config
This is my personal Emacs config.

I wrote this config to self install the required plugins before configuring them.
## Installation of plugins 
There are two ways to install a plugin: [ELPA](https://github.com/tjaartvdwalt/emacs-config/blob/master/config/elpa.el) or [el-get](https://github.com/tjaartvdwalt/emacs-config/blob/master/config/el-get.el)
Elpa is the preferred installation method but el-get can install packages from more sources.

### ELPA
The way to install a package is:
```
(elpa-install 'my-package)
```

### el-get



## Plugins
### mu4e
[mu4e](https://github.com/tjaartvdwalt/emacs-config/blob/master/config/mu4e.el)
This config is a work in progress.

I configure multiple email accounts. The idea is that (eventually) you will be able to set your email folders in the `my-mu4e-account-alist` variable and the rest of the config will use these details.
