The yasnippets in the jquery directory is a copy of the following github repo:
https://github.com/jpablobr/yasnippets-jquery

The repo is distributed under the MIT license and does not seem to be under active development
so I decided to import it into my config rather than to have to clone it everytime I rebuild
my config.
